To ensure your PWA (Progressive Web App) looks and behaves like a native app, particularly on iOS and Android, it's important to include additional fields in your `manifest.json`. While certain platform-specific features (like splash screens and app locking) are not directly defined in the web app manifest, you can include fields in your manifest and provide the necessary styles and assets to give a native feel.

Here's a more detailed version of your `manifest.json`, including additional fields for Android and iOS compatibility, along with configuration for splash screens and making the app appear more native:

```json
{
    "name": "Next.js PWA",
    "short_name": "NextPWA",
    "description": "A Progressive Web App built with Next.js",
    "start_url": "/",

        },
        {

            "sizes": "828x1792",
            "type": "image/png"
        },

            "sizes": "2048x2732",
            "type": "image/png"
        }
    ],
    "prefer_related_applications": false,
    "related_applications": [],
    "fingerprint": true,    
    "web_app_capable": true, // Optional: Tells iOS the app is designed as a web app
    "status_bar_color": "#000000", // Customize status bar color for Android
    "full_screen": true,  // Setting for Android to run in full screen
    "screen_orientation": "portrait" // Manage orientation across devices
}
```

### Key Additions & Their Functions

1. **splash_screens**: An array of splash screen images for different device resolutions. This gives the app a native look when launching.
   - **Sizes**: Provide images in the commonly used resolutions for both iOS and Android devices.

2. **fingerprint**: While this property doesnâ€™t provide fingerprint lock specifically, implementing biometric authentication can be a part of your app's functionality if required.

3. **web_app_capable**: This property signals to iOS that the application is a web app, which can influence how it operates when saved to the home screen.

4. **status_bar_color**: Customizes the status bar color for Android to match your theme.

5. **full_screen**: Indicates that the app should run in full screen on Android, eliminating the browser UI.

6. **screen_orientation**: Specifies the default orientation for the application.

### Additional Considerations

- **Service Worker**: Ensure you have a properly configured service worker that handles caching for offline capabilities and performance improvements.
  
- **Icons**: Ensure your icon paths are correct and the images are properly sized. Consider using tools like `realfavicongenerator.net` to generate icons and splash screens for multiple platforms.

- **Test Across Devices**: Test the PWA across different devices to ensure the splash screens load correctly and the UX matches that of a native app.

- **PWA Features**: If you want even more native-like features, consider implementing push notifications, background sync, and file handling by configuring your service worker.

- **Screen Locks**: While you cannot lock the application in the same way native apps do, you can implement authentication features that require users to log in or use biometrics to access specific parts of the app.
